This is a little program to generate a worlist.
If you are on linux please change #define CLEAR "cls" for #define CLEAR "clear" in the file wordlist.h on line 7.
If you want to add or remove some charaters to the words that are generated you can change : #define CHARACTERS in the file wordlist.h on line 5.
You can also change the file where the worlist is outputted by modifying the : #define WORDLIST_FILE in the file wordlist.h on line 6.
